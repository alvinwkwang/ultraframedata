Overview
==============

This is a personal project combining my interests of web applications and video games.

Frames is a Play application that acts as a database for all playable characters in Capcom's Ultra Street Fighter 4.
For each character, the user can view all the important frame data for each of their moves.
Additionally, the user can discover how to punish certain moves with their own.

Installation
